# Z80 backend

## Numeric formats
The Z80 backend supports an additional numeric literal format. The first character is the backtick:

```
`00112233
```

The values are pixel values. The values are converted from chunky data format to the planar format used by the Game Boy.

## Sections

The Game Boy supports several banks of code and data. In addition to fixing a section to a specific address, it's also possible to force it into a specific bank:

```
SECTION "FixedSection",DATA[$1100],BANK[3]
````

It's also possible to only specify the bank:

```
SECTION "FixedSection",CODE,BANK[3]
````
