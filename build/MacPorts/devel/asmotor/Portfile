description         A cross assembler, linker and librarian for several CPUs.

long_description    ASMotor is a portable and generic assembler engine and \
                    development system written in ANSI C. The package \
                    consists of the assembler, the librarian and the linker. \
                    It can be used as either a cross or native development \
                    system. The assembler syntax is based on the A68k style \
                    macro language. Currently supported CPUs are the 680x0 \
                    family, 6502, MIPS32, SChip/Chip-8, DCPU-16, Z80 and \
                    Gameboy.
